## About Me
Hi, I'm Thiruvengadam Pillai, a passionate entrepreneur and web3 enthusiast. I am the co-founder of Buidl Studio and PeerHive.

## Background
I have a strong background in the web development industry and a deep interest in the emerging technologies of web3. I am constantly exploring and learning about decentralized applications, blockchain, and other related concepts.

## Projects
- **Buidl Studio**: Initially started as a metaverse agency, Buidl Studio has gradually pivoted to a digital agency focusing mainly on web and app development. At Buidl Studio, we specialize in technologies such as React.js, React Native, Node.js, Express.js, Vite.js, Next.js, and MongoDB. For app development, we primarily use React Native, which allows us to build cross-platform mobile applications. We also make use of Tailwind CSS <code><img height="10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/202896760-337261ed-ee92-4979-84c4-d4b829c7355d.png" alt="Tailwind CSS" title="Tailwind CSS"/></code>, a utility-first CSS framework, to create responsive and streamlined user interfaces.

- **PeerHive**: PeerHive is a peer-to-peer blockchain lending platform. It provides a decentralized solution for lending and borrowing, leveraging the power of blockchain technology.

## Interests
I am particularly interested in the intersection of technology, entrepreneurship, and community building. I believe in the power of decentralized technologies to create a more open and inclusive internet.
